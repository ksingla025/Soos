Multilingual Multimedia Message Board

As we continue to work, travel and share information between each other irrespective of geographical and cultrul demographics our conversations are becoming more multilingual.  However according to X,  95% people in the world don't speak more than 2 languages.  There are many social platforms like facebook, tiktok and rediit however they all offer limited multilingual conversation.

We propose SoooS: a multilingual multimedia message board. This message-board can be seen as new form of reditt which is free and open-source. Here a user A only speaking a language A, can send video/audio/text messages to a user B who only speaks a language B.
